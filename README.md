### Dysnatremias and Renal Replacement

  Severe dysnatremias are perplexing problems in patients undergoing renal replacement therapy on a chronic or acute basis. The ability to manipulate sodium concentration in the dialysate or replacement solutions is limited. 

Below are simple formulas to help determine the rate of hypotonic or hypertonic solutions needed to mitigate rapid correction of dysnatremias. These formulas can be used readily by the clinician at bedside.

#### Hyponatremia in hemodialysis patients

[Formula 1: Increase in serum sodium at the end of hemodialysis session](https://na1.stackblitz.io)

  

[Formula 2: Blood flow rate (Qb) needed for a slow rise in serum sodium](https://na2.stackblitz.io)

  

[Formula 3: Volume of D5W needed to slow down the rate of serum sodium rise](https://na3.stackblitz.io)

  

#### Hypernatremia in hemodialysis patients

[Formula 4: Volume of 3% saline needed to slow down rapid the rate of serum sodium decline](https://na4.stackblitz.io)

  

#### Hyponatremia in CRRT

[Formula 5: Volume of D5W needed to slow the rate of serum sodium rise in CVVH](https://na5.stackblitz.io)

  

[Formula 6: Volume of D5W needed to slow the rate of serum sodium rise in CVVHDF](https://na6.stackblitz.io)

  

[Formula 7: Increase in serum na after 1 hour of CRRT](https://na7.stackblitz.io)

  

#### Hypernatremia in CRRT

  

[Formula 8: Volume of 3% saline to slow the decline in serum sodium in CVVHDF](https://na8.stackblitz.io)

  

[Formula 9: Decrease in serum sodium after 1 hour of CRRT](https://na9.stackblitz.io)
